FROM T1 
WHERE Ranking = 1 
ORDER BY CustomerID ASC;
GO
```


```python
WITH 
T1 AS (
	SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(TransactionID) AS QTransaction 
    FROM (
		SELECT T.TransactionID, T.AccountID, A.CustomerID 
        FROM Ch4.Transactions T
		LEFT JOIN (SELECT * FROM Ch4.Accounts) A
		ON (T.AccountID = A.AccountID)
	) AS X
	GROUP BY CustomerID
),
T2 AS (	
	SELECT * FROM T1
	WHERE QTransaction = (SELECT MAX(QTransaction) FROM T1)
)
SELECT C.* FROM Ch4.Customers AS C 
INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM T2) T2
ON (C.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID)
GO
```
